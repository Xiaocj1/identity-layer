# The Genesis of Send in Peace Protocol

## Article 1: Context Sovereignty
Any implementation MUST allow users to create and fully isolate multiple digital identity contexts.

## Article 2: Risk Awareness
The system MUST provide an unavoidable, conscious confirmation before high-risk operations (e.g., cross-context communication).

## Article 3: Protocol Commons
Any project claiming compatibility MUST open-source its core context-isolation modules.

### Governance Vision (Aspirational)
1.  Initial stewardship by community-elected provisional conveners.
2.  Evolution toward a randomly selected, rotating council.
3.  Ultimate goal: representation-minimized governance via referendum and algorithm.

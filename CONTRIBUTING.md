# Contributing to the Send in Peace Protocol

## What this repository IS
- A protocol proposal and governance experiment.
- The canonical source for the `GENESIS.md` principles.
- **The trigger box for the autonomous stewardship transition** (see `GOVERNANCE_TRANSITION.md`).

## What this repository is NOT
- A codebase for a specific implementation.
- A general discussion forum (use **GitHub Discussions**).

## How to contribute to THIS REPO (before the transition)
We only accept minor fixes to:
- `README.md` (for clarity)
- `GENESIS.md` (for typographical errors only)
- Files in the `Whitepaper/` directory (for translations or typos)

## 🛠️ THE REAL CONTRIBUTION: Build the Ecosystem
1.  **Understand the vision** by reading the [Whitepaper](./Whitepaper/whitepaper.md).
2.  **Adhere to the three principles** in [`GENESIS.md`](./GENESIS.md).
3.  **Create your own repository and start building.**
4.  **Claim your place in protocol history:** Once you have a working prototype, **submit an `[Implementation]` Issue** to this repo. This is the act that can trigger our collective governance future.

**State clearly:** "This project is inspired by the Send in Peace Protocol principles."

## 🌱 Nurturing the Commons
Found a great article, made a cool design, or wrote a research paper? Share it in **Discussions** or, for significant non-code contributions, propose adding it to the `Implementations/` directory via a Pull Request.

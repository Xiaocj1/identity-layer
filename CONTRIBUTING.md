# Contributing to the Send in Peace Protocol

## What this repository IS
- A **protocol proposal** and **governance experiment**.
- The **canonical source** for the [GENESIS.md](GENESIS.md) principles.
- The **arena** for the autonomous stewardship transition (see [README.md](README.md)).

## What this repository is NOT
- A **codebase** for a specific implementation.
- A **general discussion forum** for digital identity (use GitHub Discussions or external forums).

## How to contribute (before the transition)
We only accept minor fixes to:
- The `README.md` (for clarity)
- The `GENESIS.md` (for typographical errors only)
- Files in the `Whitepaper/` directory (for translations or typos)

## The REAL contribution
**Build your own implementation.**
1.  Read the [Whitepaper](Whitepaper/en.md) to understand the vision.
2.  Adhere to the three principles in [GENESIS.md](GENESIS.md).
3.  Create your own repository and start building.
4.  State clearly that your project is "inspired by the Send in Peace Protocol principles."

This repository is the **seed**. Your implementations are the **trees**.

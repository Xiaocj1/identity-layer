# Identity Layer · English Whitepaper

> **Let machines know who you are—filling a 40-year gap in the internet's foundation.**

---

## 📖 Abstract

Since 1984, the OSI model has been the cornerstone of network communication. Its 7 layers define how data travels from physical media to user applications.

**But one layer has been missing—the Identity Layer.**

It belongs **above Session (Layer 5) and below Presentation (Layer 6)**. Its job: **Tell the machine *who* is communicating, not just transmit *data*.**

This is not a final proposal. It's an invitation. A question worth asking together.

## Chapter 1: A Question Worth Asking

### 1.1 The Hawking Question

Stephen Hawking visits China. The host proposes a toast. Does he stand up?

- If he stands: He's disabled. His body doesn't allow it.
- If he doesn't: He's a guest. Not standing could seem impolite.
- As a scientist: Academic equality—no need to stand.
- As a foreigner: He might not know the custom.

**One person. Four identities. Four possible answers.**

This isn't a trick question. It points to something deeper.

### 1.2 Moments You Might Recognize

Have you ever:

- Sent a message to the wrong group chat? That split-second heart drop?
- Wanted to write something late at night, but stopped yourself?
- Gotten a new phone and dreaded re-logging into every app?
- Received calls meant for the previous owner of your number?

These aren't personal failures. They're symptoms of something missing.

### 1.3 The OSI Model's 40-Year Gap

The OSI model has served us well since 1984:

1. **Physical** — cables, fiber
2. **Data Link** — Ethernet
3. **Network** — IP
4. **Transport** — TCP/UDP
5. **Session** — managing connections
6. **Presentation** — encryption, compression
7. **Application** — HTTP, SMTP

Look closely: **The machine knows where data comes from, but not *who* sent it.**

That missing piece—what if we called it the Identity Layer?

## Chapter 2: A Vision, Not a Blueprint

### 2.1 What If?

What if your devices actually knew you?

- Switch contexts, and your phone understands who you are right now.
- Get a new phone? Log in once. Everything is there.
- Have thoughts you don't want to share? A space that's truly yours.
- Your digital self—yours. Not owned by any company. Not locked into any ecosystem.

### 2.2 Why the Protocol Layer?

If every app builds its own identity system:

- WeChat has one
- TikTok has one
- Taobao has one
- Users manage countless accounts
- Developers rebuild the same thing over and over

If it lives at the protocol layer:

- Define it once. Every app can use it.
- One identifier works everywhere.
- Build once. Everyone benefits.

Application-layer identity is an **account**.  
Protocol-layer identity is **you**.

Accounts multiply. You don't.

## Chapter 3: Many Lenses, One Question

### 3.1 What Engineers Bring

Engineers excel at turning ideas into working systems. They think in terms of feasibility, performance, edge cases. Their questions tend to start with "how."

### 3.2 What Product People Bring

Product people excel at noticing what's missing. They think in terms of user experience, unspoken needs, the gap between what is and what could be. Their questions tend to start with "why."

### 3.3 What Everyone Brings

Anyone who's ever hesitated before posting, double-checked a group chat, or wished for a space that felt truly private—they bring something too. Perspective. Lived experience. The sense that something isn't quite right.

Different questions. Different lenses. One shared curiosity.

## Chapter 4: An Invitation

### 4.1 Not a Blueprint—Yet

This isn't a finished proposal. It's a starting point. A question worth exploring together.

If you're a product person: What questions come to mind? What would you want this to feel like?

If you're an engineer: What seems feasible? What would need to be true?

If you're neither: What resonates? What's missing?

### 4.2 A Place to Explore

If this resonates, there's a place to continue the conversation—a GitHub repository with some initial thoughts and a simple structure for those who want to think through this together. Nothing final. Everything provisional.

### 4.3 No Pressure, Just Curiosity

Some people will find this interesting. Some won't. Some will have ideas. Some will just watch. All of it is welcome.

---

## Chapter 5: A Larger Context

### 5.1 For Users

Fewer "wrong chat" moments. Less friction when switching devices. Spaces that feel like they're actually yours.

### 5.2 For Developers

Less rebuilding. More time for what makes your app unique.

### 5.3 For the Broader Conversation

Standards have often been shaped by a few voices in closed rooms. What if the next one was shaped by many voices, in the open?

### 5.4 A Question, Not a Prediction

Whether this particular idea goes anywhere is unknowable. What's knowable is that questions about digital identity aren't going away. They're becoming more relevant, not less.

---

## Chapter 6: One More Question

The Hawking question doesn't have a single right answer. That's what makes it interesting.

Maybe the missing layer doesn't either.

Maybe the answer emerges from enough people asking the question together.
